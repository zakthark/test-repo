## Oracle Cloud Private DNS

Customers want to specify their own private DNS domain names to manage their private assets in OCI, as well as support DNS resolution between  VCNs and between VCNs and on-premise networks. Private DNS will give them the ability to:
- Create private DNS zones with their desired names and create records for their private resources
- Private DNS resolver for DNS resolution to and from other private networks
- Resolve queries for custom private zones and system generated zones (oraclevcn.com)
- Support for DNS views and conditional forwarding  for split-horizon environments
