# Deploying Jenkins

## Introduction

Faster software development has become a competitive advantage for companies. The automation of software development processes facilitates speed and consistency, which led to the rise for having a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) pipelines. Jenkins is a very popular product among Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, which can automate all of the phases of CI and CD. You can host Jenkins on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize your build automation and scale your deployment as the needs of your software projects grow.

    cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
    </copy>
    ```

11. Enter **ls** and verify id\_rsa file exists.

12. Enter command: 
    
    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    ssh -i id_rsa opc@PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE
    </copy>
    ```
    **HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. You MUST type the command, do NOT copy and paste ssh command.

13. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0014.PNG " ")

    <copy>
    oci setup config
    </copy>
    ```

17. Accept the default location. For user OCID switch to OCI Console window. Click Human Icon and then your user name. In the user details page Click **copy** to copy the OCID. **Also note down your region name as shown in OCI Console window**. Paste the OCID in ssh session.

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_004.PNG " ")

18. Repeat the step to find tenancy OCID (Human icon followed by Clicking Tenancy Name). Paste the Tenancy OCID in ssh session to compute instance followe by providing your region name (us-ashburn-1, us-phoenix-1 etc).

19. When asked for **Do you want to generate a new RSA key pair?** answer Y. For the rest of the question accept default by pressing Enter.

    ![](./../deploying-oci-streaming-service/images/Stream_005.PNG " ")

20. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :

    ```
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
    </copy>
    ```
